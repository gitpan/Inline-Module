NAME
    Inline::Module - Support for Inline-based CPAN Extension Modules

SYNOPSIS
    In "Makefile.PL":

        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
        WriteMakefile(
          NAME => 'Module::Name',
          ...,
        );

        use lib 'inc';
        use Inline::Module::MakeMaker;
        FixMakefile(module => 'Module::Name');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides support and documentation for creating and
    maintaining CPAN extension modules. ie Writing XS modules without having
    to learn XS.

    The Inline::Module::Tutorial explains the simple processes involved.

    When used from a "Makefile.PL", this module provides support for
    modifying the Makefile generated by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

EXPORTS
    This module exports "FixMakefile" when used from a "Makefile.PL".

    "FixMakefile" takes the following arguments:

  Arguments
    Arguments are key/value pairs.

    "module"
            module => 'My::Module',

        Required. This is the module that contains inline "C" or "C++" code.
        It can be an array ref of multiple modules.

    "inline"
            inline => 'My::Module::Inline',

        Optional. This is the name of the Inline::Module generated stub
        module. It's value defaults to the "module" argument with '::Inline'
        appended. It can be an array ref of multiple modules.

    "ilsm"
            ilsm => 'Inline::CPP',

        Optional. This is the Inline Language Support Module (ilsm) that you
        are using. It defaults to Inline::C. It can be an array ref of
        multiple ilsm-s.

SCRIPT
    This module provides a script to generate a required Inline stub file.

        > perl-inline-module generate Module::Name::Inline
        Inline module 'Module::Name::Inline' generated as 'lib/Module/Name/Inline.pm'

TPF GRANT
    This module was written as the major portion of the work for a 2014 Perl
    Foundation grant:

NOTE
    When this module was first created in November 2014, we belatedly
    realized that there was already an Inline::Module on CPAN, by Ingy. The
    other one is to "inline" one module inside another. It appears that
    nobody uses the old one, but if that is not the case, contact INGY and
    he'll redo that one under another name.
