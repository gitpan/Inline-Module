NAME
    Inline::Module - Support for Inline-based CPAN Extension Modules

SYNOPSIS
        > perl-inline-module generate Module::Name::Inline
        Inline module 'Module::Name::Inline' generated as 'lib/Module/Name/Inline.pm'

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides support and documentation for creating and
    maintaining CPAN extension modules. ie Writing XS modules without having
    to learn XS.

    The Inline::Module::Tutorial explains the simple processes involved.

TPF GRANT
    This module was written as the major portion of the work for a 2014 Perl
    Foundation grant:

    <http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/09/grant-proposal-inlinecpp-modul.h
    tml>

    *   Inline::CPP

NOTE
    When this module was first created in November 2014, we belatedly
    realized that there was already an Inline::Module on CPAN, by Ingy. The
    other one is to "inline" one module inside another. It appears that
    nobody uses the old one, but if that is not the case, contact INGY and
    he'll redo that one under another name.
